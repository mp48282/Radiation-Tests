/** @example example_TI_Fee_Write_Read.c
*   This is an example which descibes the steps to use TI-Fee Driver for simple Write Sync, Write Async,
*   Read, Invalidate and Full Format of EEPROM bank.
*
*   @b Step @b 1:
*
*   Create a new project.
*
*   Navigate: -> File -> New -> Project -> TMS570xx / RMx
*
*   @b Step @b 2:
*
*   Configure driver code generation:
*   - Enable TI-FEE driver
*   - Disable others
*
*   Navigate: -> TMS570xx / RMx -> Driver Enable
*
*   @b Step @b 3:
*
*   Navigate: -> TMS570xx / RMx -> TI-FEE
*
*   Configure FEE settings ( Leave Default for below Example)
*
*   @b Step @b 4:
*
*   Navigate: -> File -> Generate Code
*
*   @b Step @b 5:
*
*   Copy source code below into your application.
*
*   @b Step @b 6:
*
*   Add F021 Library files to CCS Project
*   - Add/Link F021_API_CortexR4_BE.lib from folder C:/ti/Hercules/F021 Flash API/2.01.01 to CCS Project
*   - Add Path C:/ti/Hercules/F021 Flash API/2.01.01/include to Include Path in CCS Project
*
*   The example file example_TI_Fee_Write_Read.c can also be found in the examples folder: ../HALCoGen/examples
*
*   @note HALCoGen generates an enpty main function in sys_main.c,
*         please make sure that you link in the right main function or copy the source into the user code sections of this file.
